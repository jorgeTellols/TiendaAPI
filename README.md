# Music Academy/Shop API.

"Back" of a website designed to be a music academy and at the same time an instrument store. It can perform a couple of basic CRUD operations and was ready to add future features, but I didn't get to create them due to lack of time. The API has the dependencies to use swagger, so it generates documentation on all its endpoints when launched. The only requirement for its correct launch is to define an empty database in a postgreSQL server called "academiaModoFrigio", once created manually the creation/update of the tables will occur whenever the project is launched.

This API was the "Back" part of my TFG (The final project of my degree) and I have decided to upload it to record it because, unlike the "Front" part, I was satisfied with the result. The API generates a database and prepares the endpoints to be consumed by another application.
